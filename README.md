## 1. üö¥üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Human Mobility Analysis

Human mobility pattern analysis using a variety of methods and data sources. A research paper was also written based on the GEO 7361 *(Advanced Geographic Information Systems)* final project. For more details, see the [2025-MetroBike Project](https://github.com/lucyubin/research/tree/main/2025-MetroBike)
<br/>
- **Data**: New York taxi OD, Austin MetroBike OD data
- **Methods**: API integration, JSON data parsing, Entropy, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), Community detection, GWR

| Year | Course | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 2024 | [7361](./2024-fall) | Analyzed mobility patterns using New York taxi data and Austin's MetroBike data |

## 2. üö∂üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è *CampusPath*: ArcGIS Pro Toolbox

Developed an ArcGIS Pro toolbox named *CampusPath*, in the GEO 7419 class *(Advanced Techniques in Geographic Information Science)*, designed to find optimized walking routes on campus by considering shade, slope, and indoor accessibility. I led the project in ideation, research design, and Python coding.
<br/>

- **Data**: OpenStreetMap (OSM) street network, building entrance points, slope lines, and DSM raster data  
- **Methods**: Hillshade analysis, ArcGIS toolbox development, weighted shortest path network analysis

| Year | Course  | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 2025 | [7419](./2025-spring/7419) | A custom ArcGIS Pro toolbox for shortest path analysis on the Texas State University campus, considering indoor access points, slope, and shaded areas. |
